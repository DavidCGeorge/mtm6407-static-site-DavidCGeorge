The most legendary card ever made is black lotus. One recently sold as a PSA 10 (perfect condition) for $3,000,000 USD! That happens to be the most
expensive card ever sold. The second most was the one of one "The One Ring" from the Lord of the Rings collaboration set. This was a special version of the card that had much cooler art and was hidden within one random pack for a lucky opener! It was sold upon opening to musician Post
Malone for $2,000,000 and is also one of the best newest cards (it is availible as a regular version for much cheaper!). The person who opened the card from the pack was a man from Toronto. The third card I'll be talking about is Time Walk. It is a blue card that is from a very early set. It allows the user to take another turn after the completion of their current turn. Although there are other cards that do the same thing, this one 
is very little mana making it extremly easy to cast.
