Green White Ramp:
My favourite deck I've ever played with was a green-white ramp deck. The purpose of the deck was to get lots of mana with my green ramp cards, and 
use punishing big creatures, and green/white plainswalkers, to win the game. At the time I played it, it was standard legal. As well as my favouite deck, it was also my strongest. Here is my favourite card from the deck was Ajani, Mentor of Heros. 

Jeskai Polymorph Commander:
A deck I am currently enjoying is a Jeskai Commander deck with Kayko, the Winds Fury as the commander. It generates a lot of tokens with non-creature spells and then turns them into creatures from my deck with cards like polymorph! It is extremly fun to play and being my first commander deck I've ever built, a great introduction to the format! 




Jeskai Ascendency Combo:
This was a cool deck that I made that contained an infinite loop. It was standard legal at the time, and was very intresting to play. The idea was if I got the proper assortment of cards I'd win, if I couldn't get those card in time though I would lose. Because of this it became very repetitive to play and I eventually just disbanded the deck and played something else.
